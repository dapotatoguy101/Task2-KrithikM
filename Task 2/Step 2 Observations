'''Upon running the model on Image 1(Multicols Demo), the model is able to recognize the
words in the image well and the output is satisfactory

Upon running the model on image 2(Form 33), we notice that the model fares well in
identifying regular text, but struggles to recognize dotted lines and the text
underlined by dots

Upon running the model on Image 3(Format letter Format), we see that the model is
unable to predict any results at all, which is probably due to the low resolution
and poor quality of the image, hindering its ability to recognize the pixels in the image

We also note that the model is unable to distuinguish between fonts'''
